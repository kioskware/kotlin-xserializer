# Kotlin xSerializer

Extension for kotlin serialization, allowing to dynamically exclude some fields from the serialized output.
Comparing to `@Transient` annotation, this library allows to use custom predicate to filter properties, 
so you can skip properties based on their `SerialDescriptor`.

Perfect for filtering data based on access scopes, user roles, or any other criteria.

Developed by [kioskware.co](kioskware.co) - company delivering professional Android kiosk software and hardware. Based in Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

## Features

- âœ… Exclude properties from serialization with custom predicate
- âœ… Works with any serialization format supported by `kotlinx.serialization`
- âœ… Support for nested objects, lists, and maps
- âœ… Simple and veeery lightweight
- âœ… Works on JVM and Android (other platforms will be added in the future)

## Importing dependency

1. Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.kioskware:kotlin-xserializer:1.8.0") // or the latest version
    }
    ```
   **Note:** Make sure `xSerializer` version is the same as kotlin-serialization version 
   you are using in your project.


2. Add jitpack.io repository to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            maven("https://jitpack.io")
            gradlePluginPortal()
        }
    }
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositories {
            maven("https://jitpack.io")
            mavenCentral()
        }
    }
    ```
   
3. Add kotlin serialization plugin to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        kotlin("plugin.serialization") version "1.8.0" // or the latest version
    }
    ```

## Usage

1. Create `PropertyFilter` function:

    ```kotlin
    val filter : PropertyFilter = {
        propertyAnnotations.none { it is SkipSerialization }
    }
    ```

2. Create data class with `@Serializable` annotation and use `@SkipSerialization` annotation on properties you want to skip:

    ```kotlin
    @Serializable
    data class Address(
        val street: String,
        val city: String,
        @SkipSerialization
        val zipCode: String? = null
    )
    ```

3. Use `filteredSerializer()` method to create a serializer that applies the filter:

    ```kotlin
    val serializer = filteredSerializer<Address>(filter)
    ```
4. Serialize your data class using the filtered serializer:

    ```kotlin
    val address = Address("123 Main St", "Springfield", "12345")
    val json = Json.encodeToString(serializer, address)
    println(json) // Output: {"street":"123 Main St","city":"Springfield"}
    ```
   **Note:** `kotlinx-serialization-json` is not included in this library, you need to add it separately to your dependencies or use another serialization format.
